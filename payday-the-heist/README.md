This has my antimicro setup for mapping xbox 360 controller => keyboard for Payday 1 (Payday: The Heist).

Compare to [default controls](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=162988338) or alternate mapping [1](https://www.rewasd.com/community/config/payday-the-heist-controller-support/1dfa0b420df4373fc8db20cfd3e70c75) or [2](https://gimx.fr/forum/viewtopic.php?t=390).

## Details

I don't plan on using the in-game chat/push-to-talk as there as much better tools available such as Steam Chat, Discord, or even Mumble. And honestly, if you are playing on PC with a controller, you should have some kind of keyboard handy - even if its a smaller htpc keyboard (I recommend the k400/k830; both are good). Skipping these mappings keeps things simple and avoids overcrowding on the controller.

For the D-Pad, I set it up with a Gears of War-inspired layout in mind.
