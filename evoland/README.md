## Description

This has my antimicro setup for mapping xbox 360 controller => keyboard for Evoland 1. I haven't played this in awhile so there might be some issues with it that I don't remember (e.g. mislabeled file/wrong game, bad mappings, something i didn't map, requires setting up custom keyboard mappins in-game, etc).

Compare with [default controls](https://evoland.gamepedia.com/Evoland#Controls)
