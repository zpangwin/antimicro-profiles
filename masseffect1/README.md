# Mass Effect 1

Experimented with creating a template image from an old mapping I had and trying to document some of the changes.

Also including my game config files. I confirmed some values against the Proton version of the game on Mint 19.3 but have not actually tested these in-game.

Most of the changes had been previously tested in antimicro on windows several years back but there is a small possibility that I messed something up when remapping. Will update if/when I go back and confirm things in-game.

On Linux, BIOInput.ini goes in `{SteamDir}/steamapps/compatdata/17460/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/My Documents/BioWare/Mass Effect/Config` where SteamDir corresponds to either your custom steam library folder or the default of `~/.local/share/Steam`.
