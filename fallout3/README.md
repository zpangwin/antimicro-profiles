## Description

This has my antimicro setup for mapping xbox 360 controller => keyboard for Gothic 1. I haven't played this in awhile so there might be some issues with it that I don't remember (e.g. mislabeled file/wrong game, bad mappings, something i didn't map, requires setting up custom keyboard mappins in-game, etc).

## Details

Pretty sure this is the one I actually used when I played the game but I admit that it has been awhile. In general, I tend to avoid mapping functions to the trigger "click" options as I usually fatfinger these during combat and then let out a string of curses.

So basic idea is two control "Sets" (or layouts if you prefer). The core movement and combat keys remain the same between both layouts so that it's less of a bitch if you get attacked while fucking around in the other layout... or when antimicro screws up and gets stuck on a layout (rare but it does happen... Alt+tab and reload AM to fix). Having two layouts allows you to have access to all 10 quickslot items, map, character screen, inventory, quickload/quicksave, and probably some other stuff I am forgetting.

Since it has been awhile, I am not sure if I had remapped any of the keyboard bindings or not. Usually, I try to mostly leave stuff as the defaults (in case I get sidetracked / switch computers / switch distros / etc that I don't have to re-configure much... i am lazy). But occassionally, I will remap something if the original gets in the way (read: i keep fatfingering it on accident / can't think of a mneumonic that makes sense for that function / etc).

Compare with [default controls](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Controls).

#### Set \#2 (when Left Bumper held)

Note: Joysticks (Movement and Camera) and Trigger controls remain the same in both control sets to give you a fighting change when you get the occasional "oh fuck" situations where you are attacked while messing with something on control set \#2 / antimicro bugs out and locks on control set \#2 (rare but have had it happen a few times).
