## Description

This has my antimicro setup for mapping xbox 360 controller => keyboard for Beyond Good and Evil.

Compare to [default controls](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Beyond_Good_%26_Evil/Controls)

## Details

I have created 2 profiles. The main difference is that I have switched the role of triggers as compared with console controller mappings; this was mostly due to preferring right trigger for attack. As a result, I ended up moving several other buttons to better accomodate things under that layout.

I have named them accordingly: Beyond-good-and-evil_trigger_is_attack and Beyond-good-and-evil_trigger_is_run. The latter is more similar to the original console mappings while the former is more customized and IMHO closer to most shooter games.

### "trigger_is_attack" Profile

This is my preferred profile but it is more customized and further away from original console mappings.

### "trigger_is_run" Profile

This is closer to original (xbox 360) console mappings but I am less likely to keep it updated; consider this to be my "red-headed step-child" profile as it were.
